🚀 **Embarking on a New Journey: The 75 Hard Coding Challenge** 🚀

Hey #GithubCommunity,

I hope this finds you all in great spirits! As many of you know, life can sometimes throw unexpected curveballs, and I recently found myself facing a new chapter due to a company shutdown that led to the loss of my job. While this has been a challenging time, I firmly believe in turning setbacks into opportunities for growth.

I am taking on the **75 Hard Coding Challenge**! 🧠💪 This journey is all about pushing myself, refining my problem-solving skills, and diving deep into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I truly believe that challenges like these are not just about skill enhancement, but also about fostering discipline, resilience, and continuous self-improvement.

Here's a glimpse of what my daily routine will look like during the challenge:

🌅 **Morning Routine**:
- Wake up with enthusiasm and determination.
- Hit the gym for an energizing workout session.
- Nourish my body with a healthy breakfast to kick-start the day.

📚 **Coding Sessions (6 hours total)**:
- Dive into 3 hours of intense LeetCode DSA problem-solving.
- Afternoon break: Engage in activities like playing video games, watching YouTube/Netflix (1.5 hrs).
- Dive back into another 3 hours of focused LeetCode problem-solving.

🚶‍♂️ **Physical and Mental Breaks**:
- Enjoy an invigorating evening snack followed by a refreshing walk (1.5 hrs).

🌐 **Web Development Journey**:
- Devote time to brush up on and learn web development.
- Engage in building live full-stack projects, including a collaborative document editor and a captivating portfolio website.

🌙 **Evening Routine**:
- Savor a nourishing dinner to recharge.
- Wind down with a self-help book to enrich my mind before bedtime.

Let's conquer challenges, empower one another, and celebrate growth! 🌱 Stay tuned for updates as I embark on the #75HardCodingChallenge. Feel free to reach out if you have any tips, suggestions, or if you'd like to connect and share your journey too.

Here's to new beginnings and the pursuit of excellence! 🚀💻
